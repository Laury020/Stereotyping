# Stereotyping
Code created for analysing all the surveys created for my research in Berkeley with Ming Hsu
This code is used to examine how stereotypes are integrated. 
The data is preprossesed in excel, loaded into python, data is plotted and models are fitted and selected.
Finally, the models are extrapolated to out of sample data.
